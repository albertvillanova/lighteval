# Generating the documentation

To generate the documentation, you first have to build it. Several packages are necessary to build the doc,
you can install them with the following command, at the root of the code repository:

```bash
pip install -e ".[docs]"
```

Then you need to install our special tool that builds the documentation:

```bash
pip install hf-doc-builder
```

---
**NOTE**

You only need to generate the documentation to inspect it locally (if you're planning changes and want to
check how they look before committing for instance). You don't have to `git commit` the built documentation.
